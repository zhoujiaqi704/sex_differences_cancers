The impact of sex on DNA methylation across nine cancer types
=
**Abstract**  
Sex differences exist in numerous non-reproductive cancers, but whether the extent of these differences is reorganized during tumorigenesis remains uncharacterized. Here, we investigated the influence of sex on DNA methylation (DNAm) across nine types of cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Comparative analysis with matched normal adjacent tissues revealed a predominant attenuation of sex differences in DNAm across all nine cancers. Comparing the correlation and magnitude relationships of cancer-related DNAm changes between sexes revealed that the DNAm changes were highly correlated, but the magnitude differed between sexes (termed “amplification”). Among cancer-related CpGs, we prioritized 3361 female-amplifiers and 11837 male-amplifiers across cancers. Integrating sex-amplifiers with the downstream transcriptome highlighted consistent sex-specific differential expression (e.g., GATA2 and ZBP1). These genes regulated by sex-amplifiers were enriched for cancer development-related pathways, including vasculature development and sprouting angiogenesis. Taken together, our findings reveal an extensive attenuation of sex differences in DNAm across cancers and emphasize the amplification effects as the primary driver of sex-related influences on malignancies.
